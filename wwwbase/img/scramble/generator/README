To produce one PNG tile for every letter, proceed as follows.

1. Create a file letters.html containing the CSS buttons.
2. Install phantomjs
3. Create a rasterize.js file telling phantomjs to rasterize letters.html into letters.png
4. Run "phantomjs rasterize.js"
5. Create a Bash script to crop each individual tile PNG from letters.png
